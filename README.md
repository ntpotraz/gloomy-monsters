A Gloomy Companion inspired React app for managing monster health and status effects in the table top game Gloomhaven

## Purpose
Months into our campaign, my friends and I realized how cumbersome it was for the person keeping track of the monster health and status effects. Swapping out the damage tokens for dice helped a bit, but the monster cards still got really full and a nightmare to deal with, especially with certain classes that can quickly apply debuffs to numerous monsters. Gloomy Monsters aims to declutter the table and speed up the setup so that you can get back into the action! No more sifting through stacks of monster cards to find that last scenario monster, or stacking tokens upon tokens when having to use the 10 monster sleave. Gloomy Monster takes up the size of a laptop or tablet on the table, and instantly searches and adds monsters to the scenario, containing all the stats and characteristics you need to know for each monster.

## Current Features
- Search through and select from every non-boss type monster in the game
- Track the health and status of each individual monster on the board
- Easy toggle for Elite monsters that updates the health and characteristic between elite and nonelite monsters

## Todo
- Implement bosses
- Fix the UI Monster scaling issue when there are differing number of monster types
- Allow for the selection of Scenarios for a quick automatic setup
- Improve the search UI
- Improve UI overall

This app was created as a way to get started learning React, it is at it's most basic functional level. Plan on improving in the future!
